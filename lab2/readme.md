## Instructions / How This Project Was Created

1. **HTML Structure**  
   - Used the same HTML structure from Lab 1.  
   - Added classes and ids to elements for CSS styling.

2. **CSS Styling**  
   - Created a separate `style.css` file.  
   - Styled elements using properties like `color`, `background-color`, `font-family`, `margin`, `padding`, `text-align`, `border`, `width`, `height`, etc.  
   - Linked CSS to HTML using `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`.

   - Used relative paths in HTML to include images in the webpage.

4. **Development Tools**  
   - Code written in VS Code.  
   - Previewed webpages in Google Chrome to verify styling and layout.
